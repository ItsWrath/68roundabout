# Route 68 Roundabout
Created By [ItsWrath](https://github.com/ItsWrath/panormaconstruction/new/main?readme=1)

This is my second map, it removes trash, adds trees, bushes, and shrubs as well as streeghtlights and a stop sign. It goes even better if you have some trees around Sandy, I tested it on multiple servers with no performance changes. I plan to update it as I get new ideas or suggestions.
## What It Adds
This Adds An Upgraded Roundabout On **Route 68** Across From **Yellowjack**

## Installation
- Download
- Drag Into Your `resources` Folder
- Add ``ensure 68roundabout`` To Your `server.cfg`
